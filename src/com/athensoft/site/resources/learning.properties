ceit-1101-course-desc-content-1=Java/Java Web Developer jobs known as the 1st place in the IT job market in Montreal. In addition, Java/Java Web Developers are sweet jobs highly paid by employers at present. 
ceit-1101-course-desc-content-2=This course is the first stage to the Java and Java Web Technologies. You'll be introduced to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. You'll learn fundamental programming structures including data types, operators, branching and looping structures, user-defined methods and basic data structures. You'll also play around with classes that use OOP features like encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, overloading, overriding and polymorphism. However, that is not enough for job requirement, you\u2019ll be also trained with practical techniques such as handling exceptions, file operation, establishing work environment, performing compile, package and deployment and more fancy skills.

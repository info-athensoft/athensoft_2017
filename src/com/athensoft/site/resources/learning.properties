ceit-1111-course-desc-title=Introduction
ceit-1101-course-desc-content-1=Java/Java Web Developer jobs known as the 1st place in the IT job market in Montreal. In addition, Java/Java Web Developers are sweet jobs highly paid by employers at present. 
ceit-1101-course-desc-content-2=This course is the first stage to the Java and Java Web Technologies. You'll be introduced to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. You'll learn fundamental programming structures including data types, operators, branching and looping structures, user-defined methods and basic data structures. You'll also play around with classes that use OOP features like encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, overloading, overriding and polymorphism. However, that is not enough for job requirement, you\u2019ll be also trained with practical techniques such as handling exceptions, file operation, establishing work environment, performing compile, package and deployment and more fancy skills.
ceit-1101-course-desc-content-3=You don't need any programming background to take this class but once you're finished, you will find yourself transformed from a newbie to an engineer with much more confidence.

ceit-4101-course-code=Course Code:

ceit-4101-course-desc-title=Introduction
ceit-4101-course-desc-content-1=Python is one of the top three computer programming languages in the world. The Python language is easy to learn, rich in class libraries, and powerful. Python is an interpreted language with no compilation links, similar to the Perl language. Python is interactive, and you can write your program directly in a Python prompt, and run the program immediately. Python is object-oriented, which means that Python supports object-oriented style or code encapsulation in object programming techniques. Python is a beginner's language. Python is a great language for beginner programmers. It supports a wide range of application development, from simple word processing to WWW browsers to games to servers. 
ceit-4101-course-desc-content-2=A number of world-renowned universities such as the famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Toronto, Canada, and the University of Waterloo, Canada, regards it as a compulsory subject for IT or science and engineering or even related majors in management finance.
ceit-4101-course-desc-content-3=With the advent of the era of big data, the Python language has been used as a tool language in the fields of scientific computing, matrix computing, machine learning, and neural networks. The Python community is extremely active, and Google has also strongly supported it. Python is getting more and more attention, and learners tend to be younger. More and more young people are investing in the Python language learning, and the trend is inevitable.
ceit-4101-course-desc-content-4=Athensoft Open-Minded Learning has a well-organized Python course for young beginners. We will lead candidates to systematically learn Python programming basic syntax, string manipulation and console input and output, branch and loop control process, lists and dictionaries typical data structures and operations, definition and use of functions, the concept and usage of a class, file input and output, etc.
ceit-4101-course-desc-content-5=After completing the course, students can learn advanced content and have opportunities to choose multiple development routes such as Big data, AI/Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Server-side programming, Web development, System Administration, Automated-test etc.
